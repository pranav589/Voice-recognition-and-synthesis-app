# Voice-recognition-and-synthesis-app
Its quite fascinating to see the computer to speak,listen as well as perform different activities for you. It's a fun project which uses the speech recognition,speech synthesis,etc . Whatever you speak will be displayed in the UI. Similarly,the words of the system will also be displayed in the UI. All the suggestions are welcomed.
